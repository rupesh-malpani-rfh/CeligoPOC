Steps to run this POC.

1) Download latest version of Node.js from "https://nodejs.org/en/"
2) Go inside the main project folder and in the command prompt type "npm install". It will generate a new folder called "node_modules" with all the required dependencies.
3) After that, install react-router-dom by typing "npm install --save react-router-dom"
4) Then install Material UI in the main project folder "npm install --save @material-ui/core"

Note:- I have created this scaffolding using react 'create-react-app'. So if it is not in target machine, we need to install it globally in our machine.

5) Once everything is installed, type "npm start". It will redirect to "http://localhost:3000/".
